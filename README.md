-> If you don't know how to use GitHub, check out https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

1) Please use Slack to communicate.

2) If you plan to commit new files that don't exist yet, feel free to push straight to the master branch. (i.e. images, new html files)
      Otherwise, please make a separate branch, then do a pull request after you're done modifying existing files.

3) The master branch will be the one that is uploaded to the Andromeda server cluster.
